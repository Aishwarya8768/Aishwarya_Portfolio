The project listed below is my personal project for practice.

#Project 1: Hotel Revenue Management.

I used SQL Server as the dataset for this project. I imported the data from Excel to the SQL server and then used SQL Server to connect to the data through Power Bi Desktop. In this project, we can evaluate how hotel revenue grows year after year, whether we should expand our parking lot size, and what trends we can see in the data.Fliters were also used to display objects when the value was after a specified date.

#Project No 2: Sales Dashboard

The dataset I utilized here is a csv file. In this dashboard, we can view an analysis of sales by state, year, and month.
Analytics Portfolio, category, city, shipmode, sum of profit per year, quater and sub category. Used visualizations such as slicers, cards, pie charts, gauge charts, and line charts, as well as drillthrough to explore more data on segment by profit, and tooltip page to learn more about the category and Region by profit.

#Project 3: HR Dashboard Insight

I used a csv file for this dataset. We have three sections on this dashboard: Home, Action, and Detail. on the Home tab, we can view total employees, employees due for promotion, service year, employment by job level, and employee distance status.We have employee name and monthly rate, employee number analysis, and hourlyrate by work role analysis visualization in the Action tab.We offer analyses for employee job satisfaction, employee overtime, and employeers promoted data on the Detail tab.
