The project listed below are my personal project which i have done for my practice.

#Project 1: Hotel Revenue Management.

I used SQL Server as the dataset for this project. I imported the data from Excel to the SQL server and then used SQL Server to connect to the data through Power Bi Desktop. In this project, we can evaluate how hotel revenue grows year after year, whether we should expand our parking lot size, and what trends we can see in the data.Fliters were also used to display objects when the value was after a specified date.
